# Tippy
Android app for generating tips

This is my first Android app. It was built by following a tutorial led by Rahul Pandey.

# What I learned through creating this project:
- Basic Kotlin syntax - it's very similar to Java!
- Relatively constraining objects is very cool - it makes the UI so much easier to adjust
- Android Studio has some really helpful built-in tools which make writing code faster
